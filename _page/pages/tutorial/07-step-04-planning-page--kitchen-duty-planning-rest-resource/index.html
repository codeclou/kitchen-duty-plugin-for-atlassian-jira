        <p>Basically we will build the <strong>Kitchen Duty Planning REST Resource</strong> and the <strong>Kitchen Duty Planning REST Model</strong>
            which will persist our selected weeks and users to the database.</p>

        <p>You also might want to look into <a href="/kitchen-duty-plugin-for-atlassian-jira/tutorial/03-story-workshop-for-planning-page/">the Story Workshop</a> again to recapitulate what we are going to build now.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">This chapter heavily depends on the <a href="/kitchen-duty-plugin-for-atlassian-jira/tutorial/05-step-02-planning-page--user-search-rest-resource/">configuration done in Step 2</a>.</div>

        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">What do we need exactly?</h3>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>
                    After some serious brain usage on how to store the actual data of <strong>&laquo;who has Kitchen Duty in which week?&raquo;</strong>
                    I came up with the <strong>Data-Model</strong> seen on the right.</p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Week</strong> will be the actual week number in the year, and we don't care about the year in this tutorial. So if you had kitchen duty in week 24 this year you will have it the years after as well.
                    With a little thinking ahead of how I want to use it in the JS Controller
                    I basically will select a week via a date picker and <a href="http://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/iso-week/">calculate the isoWeek in the frontend using moment.js</a></p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>User</strong> part is obvious. We will need to store a list of usernames in the database in relation with Weeks (<a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/atlassian-platform-common-components/active-objects/developing-your-plugin-with-active-objects/the-active-objects-library/manytomany-relationship"><code>@ManyToMany</code></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concerning the <strong>REST Endpoint</strong> I will want to have an URL which I can fire
                    GET requests on something like <code>/planning/week/15/users</code> and receive a list of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously the other way round would be a PUT request on <code>/planning/week/15/users</code> with a list of users
                    as request body to store the user list for the week 15.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And for our stretch-goal a GET request on <code>/planning/user/bob/weeks</code> should return a list of week numbers
                    in which Bob has Kitchen Duty.
                </p>

        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">How exactly do we persist our data?</h3>


        <p>Alright we know how we want to use our REST Endpoint from the perspective of the JS Controller. And we have some kind of clue
            on how the data should be stored theoretically.</p>

        <p>There are <strong>two main possibilities to persist data in JIRA</strong>.</p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Using the <strong><a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/common-coding-tasks/storing-plugin-settings">PluginSettingsFactory</a></strong> you
                    have an easy way to persist data. But you don't have queries and cannot build relationships like you can with a real Database.
                    So this is good if you just want to store simple stuff when you always know how to retrieve data from the PluginSettingsFactory (for example by a fixed key).
                    <br />&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then there are <strong><a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/atlassian-platform-common-components/active-objects">Active Objects</a></strong> which let you use
                    a real database with an ORM Interface. And that is definitely the choice we want to make here.
                    So you might want to stroll around the Active Objects documents a little to get a grasp of it or just continue reading since I will also introduce you to it step by step.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">

        </div>

        <div class="cs-v-spacer cs-v-spacer--big"></div>








        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">Enabling Active Objects on our Project</h3>

        <p>
            All I will be writing about Active Objects is taken from the <em><a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/atlassian-platform-common-components/active-objects/developing-your-plugin-with-active-objects">Developing your plugin with Active Objects Guide</a></em> and the <em><a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/atlassian-platform-common-components/active-objects/getting-started-with-active-objects">Getting Started with Active Objects Guide</a></em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            First of all add <a href="https://maven.atlassian.com/content/repositories/atlassian-public/com/atlassian/activeobjects/activeobjects-plugin/">Active Objects dependency</a> to your pom.xml.
        </p>

        {{ csSource(lang='xml', filepath="", filename="pom.xml", ghBaseUrl=(gitHubBaseUrlForStep4 | replace("__COMMIT__", "master")), source='
        |<dependency>
        |   <groupId>com.atlassian.activeobjects</groupId>
        |   <artifactId>activeobjects-plugin</artifactId>
        |   <version>1.1.5</version>
        |   <scope>provided</scope>
        |</dependency>
        ') }}



        <p>We need a <strong>Component Import for <code>ActiveObjects</code></strong> which will be the object we use to access the database.</p>

        <p>
            {{ csSource(lang='java', filepath="src/main/java/com/comsysto/kitchen/duty/impl/", filename="MyPluginComponentImpl.java", uniqueId='sdfrg445ger', ghBaseUrl=(gitHubBaseUrlForStep4 | replace("__COMMIT__", "30e29f5e1cc8bdb4d5a6ff72834fd4af219d4a1d")), source='
            |package com.comsysto.kitchen.duty.rest;
            |
            |import com.atlassian.activeobjects.external.ActiveObjects;
            |import com.atlassian.plugin.spring.scanner.annotation.imports.ComponentImport;
            |...
            |
            |@Named ("myPluginComponent")
            |public class MyPluginComponentImpl implements MyPluginComponent {
            |   ...
            |   @ComponentImport
            |   private ActiveObjects activeObjects;
            |   ...
            |}
            ') }}
        </p>

        <p>Now we <strong>create our first Entity <code>Week</code></strong> and define the week as integer via getter/setter.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                {{ csSource(lang='java', filepath="src/main/java/com/comsysto/kitchen/duty/ao/", filename="Week.java", uniqueId='h768go8gdfssfdsbo8gv8gbu909', ghBaseUrl=(gitHubBaseUrlForStep4 | replace("__COMMIT__", "30e29f5e1cc8bdb4d5a6ff72834fd4af219d4a1d")), source='
                |package com.comsysto.kitchen.duty.ao;
                |
                |import net.java.ao.Entity;
                |import net.java.ao.Preload;
                |
                |@Preload {{{point::1}}}
                |public interface Week extends Entity { {{{point::2}}}
                |    Integer getWeek();
                |
                |    void setWeek(Integer week);
                |}
                ') }}

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 cs-sticky-in-parent">
                <div class="list-group cs-source-point-list" data-source-target="h768go8gdfssfdsbo8gv8gbu909">
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        We annotate our class with <code>@Preload</code> which I think makes it not lazy loaded ... but you have
                        to read the docs if you want to know in detail.
                    </div>
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        The important thing is that we extend <code>Entity</code> that makes our Class automatically have <code>getID()</code>
                        so we just need to define our fields which is currently only the isoWeek.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>We just created the <code>Week</code> Entity now and we need to tell the Active Objects module of our Plugin where he can find our Entity.
            Therefore we add a section to our <code>atlassian-plugin.xml</code> file listing the Entities (Maybe there is some kind of nice Annotation to skip that step, but since the docs are very thin on that I don't know. So if you find out please tell me).</p>


        {{ csSource(lang='xml', filepath="src/main/resources/", filename="atlassian-plugin.xml", ghBaseUrl=(gitHubBaseUrlForStep4 | replace("__COMMIT__", "30e29f5e1cc8bdb4d5a6ff72834fd4af219d4a1d")), source='
        |<ao key="ao-module">

        |    <entity>com.comsysto.kitchen.duty.ao.Week</entity>
        |</ao>
        ') }}

        <div class="cs-v-spacer cs-v-spacer--big"></div>







        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">Creating a basic Week Entity and a persist-Endpoint</h3>

        <p>We are agile coders and wanna see basic results now of what we did. Therefore we will create a very basic persistTest-Endpoint to try out the ORM stuff provided by Active Objects.
            We will get rid of the endpoint later we just use it to get a feel of how Active Objects works.</p>

                        After that we set our week value and call <code>.save()</code>.
                        Now our week is persisted to the Database. Banzai!
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>Alright now startup JIRA with <code>atlas-run</code> but <strong>capture the output a file called <code>jira-stdout.log</code> so that we can grep it later</strong>. You need to have <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(Unix)">tee</a> installed.

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='atlas-run | tee jira-stdout.log', shellCmdOutput='
        |...
        |[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] INFORMATION: Server startup in 38377 ms

        |[INFO] Type Ctrl-D to shutdown gracefully
        |[INFO] Type Ctrl-C to exit
        ') }}

        <p>Open another terminal to execute some CURL commands and once JIRA has started up execute a GET Request to our persistTest Endpoint.</p>


        {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/persistTest', shellCmdOutput='
        |ok
        ') }}

        <p>Now our Week object with week 42 should have been persisted to the table Week in the database</p>

        <div class="cs-v-spacer cs-v-spacer--big"></div>









        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">Let's have a look into the Database</h3>

        <p>Alright now you need to know that <strong>JIRA runs a <a href="http://www.h2database.com/">H2 Database</a></strong> when started with <code>atlas-run</code>. And it <strong>does NOT use <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</a> anymore</strong> even though it has used HSQLDB up to some version of JIRA - but those days seem over.</p>

        <p>
            You might have wondered why you needed to capture the STDOUT of JIRA previously to <code>jira-stdout.log</code>.
            Because on line 12131415 of one trillion overall lines that atlas-run echos you will find a line starting containing <code>Database URL</code> which
            tells you the location of the H2 Database.
            And since we want to have a look we need to know where the Database resides in order to connect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now stop the <code>atlas-run</code> by pressing CTRL+C <em>(we can only look into the H2 DB if no other process uses it)</em>.
            And <strong>grep for the Database URL in the captured STDOUT</strong>.
        </p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='grep "Database URL" jira-stdout.log', shellCmdOutput='
        |[INFO] [talledLocalContainer]     Database URL   : jdbc:h2:file:/Users/...../target/jira/home/database/h2db
        ') }}

        <p>Copy the whole <code>jdbc:h2:file:/Users/...../target/jira/home/database/h2db</code> JDBC URL (I have shortened the path here)</p>

        <p>In the same terminal we now <strong>start the H2 Database Console</strong> by executing the h2.jar file. <em>(Depending on your SDK version it should be somehwere around that location and might have an alternate version number.)</em></p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='java -jar target/container/tomcat8x/cargo-jira-home/webapps/jira/WEB-INF/lib/h2-1.4.185.jar') }}

        <p>Now a Browser Tab opens with the console and you just paste the JDBC URL and click connect.</p>

                Please remember to always just look into the database.
                You should never alter the Database with SQL Statements since JIRA manages autoincrement IDs and some other Caches
                and you will surely run into strange errors if you still do so. When using Object Relational Mappers it is best not to fiddle with the Database.

        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">Adding User Class and Many-to-Many Relationship</h3>

        <p>Since we got Active Objects running successfully we now want to add a <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/atlassian-platform-common-components/active-objects/developing-your-plugin-with-active-objects/the-active-objects-library/manytomany-relationship"><code>@ManyToMany</code></a> relationship between <code>User</code> an <code>Week</code>.</p>

        <p>And when you have read the docs you will note that <strong>we need a Mapping Entity</strong> for that case. We will call it <code>UserToWeek</code>.</p>


        <p>But first we want to define the week and username as unique to avoid duplicate entries which are developer's nightmares.</p>

                        OR let me explain. What does actually happen when <code>activeObjects#create(...)</code> is called? Usually the Active Objects
                        does an INSERT into the database with null values and the autoincrement ID of the table row is then the only thing set (except for default values).
                        So right after <code>create(Week.class)</code> the week object already has an ID when calling <code>getID()</code>.
                        And now comes the tricky part. If you have defined a property as <code>@NotNull</code> Active Objects also just tries
                        to do a INSERT into the table to write the ID back to the object BUT WAIT an <strong><code>ActiveObjectsSqlException</code> is thrown</strong> since our field
                        is null and it is not allowed to be null. <strong>SOLUTION</strong>: We use <code>DBParams</code> to immediately set the NotNull-Values
                        so that the initial INSERT that is triggered by <code>create(...)</code> contains actual values for our NotNull-Fields.
                    </div>
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        We create a <code>User</code> object mapped to a Database Table row as we just did with <code>Week</code>.
                    </div>
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        We also need to set the <code>NAME</code> value initially for our NotNull-Fields.
                    </div>
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        We create a <code>UserToWeek</code> object mapped to a Database Table row as we just did with <code>User</code>.
                    </div>
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        Now we need to set the <code>User</code> and <code>Week</code> objects as reference and save.
                        By that the Many-To-Many relation between <code>User</code> and <code>Week</code> is now established.
                    </div>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
            We are all set now to start JIRA again and to test if we can really save our relationship.
            But before we do that do a quick <code>atlas-clean</code> before the next <code>atlas-run</code> so that the database gets purged.
            Otherwise you might run into <code>Unique index or primary key violation</code> errors since we have 4 week entries already all with <em>week=42</em> values.
        </p>

        <p>
            {{ csShell(shellCmd='atlas-clean') }}
        </p>


        <p>
            We startup JIRA again and call the persistTest Endpoint again.
        </p>

        <p>
            {{ csShell(shellCmd='atlas-run') }}
        </p>

        <p>
            {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/persistTest', shellCmdOutput='
            |ok
            ') }}
        </p>

        <p>
            And by calling the testPersist endpoint a second time we will get a <strong>unique constraint exception</strong> as expected.
            That is fine since that only shows that the unique constraint works and we will be throwing away the persistTest Endpoint anyways.

        <p>
            Ok we have played around a little with active objects so far and now have our data model and entities in place.
            That means we can now create the real Endpoint Methods and throw away the testPersist Endpoint.

                        In our new <strong><code>/week/{isoWeekNumber}/users</code> Endpoint</strong>
                        we start a Transaction and specify <code>Week[]</code> as return type since there is no way <em>(at least I did not find one)</em>
                        to get only one entity from the Database. We always get a List. Since we are having our unique constraints setup our lists will most likely
                        only contain one value.

                        And please be aware that you HAVE TO add spaces in <code>"WEEK = ?"</code> otherwise it is Exception-Day for you.

                        What are we doing now? We just received a Week-Array from the activeObjects object most likely being cglib-proxy objects
                        that might be lazy <em>(even though we specified <code>@Preload</code>)</em>.
                        That being said and me being very paranoid when it comes to my REST APIs I always want to seperate the Data Model that is populate
                        to the User via the API from my internal Data Model used by the Database. Therefore I always setup simple POJOs that get a copy of the relevant database values.
                        For example your REST-API User object might not contain a password property even though your Database User object does.
                        <em>(And yes we could hide it with some kind of Hide-Json-Annotation, but a clear separation is what worked best for me so far.)</em>
                        If you like you can try to skip out this step and directly pass your Database Entitiy objects out via the REST Endpoint.
                        You might need to setup the JAX-WS Annotations on your Entities then.

                        We simply check if we got an empty result from out database lookup and if not we continue.
                        And if we got an empty result we return the empty List as Endpoint response.
                        This is always better as passing NULL and having trouble in your JS Controller handling these shenanigans.

                        We iterate over our Results with a for-loop. And if you want to be fancy you can do this in a more fashioned way ...
                        I already see the scala nerds roll their eyes .... anyways we are fine with it.
                    </div>
                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        Now we create such a REST-API-Pojo via a convenience constructor to copy the needed values
                        from our database entity.

                    <div class="list-group-item cs-source-point-list__item">
                        Lastly we return our list of users as Endpoint response.

                </div>
            </div>

        <p>We have just used the <strong>REST-API-Pojos</strong> which we will define right now. No magic just getters and setters and some JAX-WS Annotations you have seen in previous steps of the tutorial already.
        The only fancy thing is the convenience constructor but yeah ... just copy paste those two since it's not a big deal.</p>

            |}
            ') }}
        </p>

        <p>Alright we again are at a point where we want to start JIRA and fire some request against our API to check it out.</p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='atlas-run') }}


        <p>Now we can query these two endpoints with the following example requests.</p>

        <p><strong>List assigned users for week 42.</strong></p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/week/42/users', shellCmdOutput='
        |[{"id":2,"username":"ichiban"}]
        ') }}

        <p><strong>List weeks for user ichiban.</strong></p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/user/ichiban/weeks', shellCmdOutput='
        |[{"id":2,"week":42}]
        ') }}


        <p>
            That is working fine. In the next section we will deal with assigning Users to Weeks and removing assignments.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cs-headline cs-headline--s">Add the PUT and DELETE Endpoints to add a User to a Week or remove him</h3>


        <p>
            Now we add the functionality to <strong>add users to weeks and remove them from weeks</strong>.
            Therefore we will need a <strong>DELETE and PUT Endpoint</strong> which we add to the <code>KitchenDutyPlanningResource</code> Class.
        </p>
        <p>
            We <strong>start with the PUT Endpoint to assign Users to Weeks</strong>.

                        and that we can skip out here.

        <p>
            To prevent code duplication and improve readability of Endpoint-code I <strong>moved some common data-access-spaghetti-code into some static Methods</strong> of the <code>KitchenDutyActiveObjectHelper</code> Class.
            It should be pretty self-explanatory.

        <p>Now we can fire up <code>atlas-run</code> once more and wait for JIRA startup.</p>

        <p><strong>Let's add a user called jimmy to a week 42</strong>. Fire up this curl command and it should return a HTTP 200 telling you it worked <em>(we use the CURL <code>-i</code> parameter to echo out the response headers and return code)</code></em>.
        We have written our Endpoints in a way so that the CURLs are idemponent. So if you fire it a second time you will get a HTTP 200 as well but since jimmy already is assigned to week 42 nothing happens internally.</p>

        <p>And by the way, we don't need to pass an ID for user since we don't know it and since the username has a unique constraint which makes it our technical primary key.</p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl -i --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' -X PUT -d \'{ "username": "jimmy" }\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/week/42/users', shellCmdOutput='
        |HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        |...
        |Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
        |Content-Length: 0
        |Date: Fri, 09 Sep 2016 16:52:06 GMT
        ') }}

        <p><strong>Let's remove a user called ichiban from week 42.</strong></p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl -i --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' -X DELETE -d \'{ "username": "ichiban" }\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/week/42/users', shellCmdOutput='

        |Content-Length: 0
        |Date: Fri, 09 Sep 2016 16:52:06 GMT
        ') }}

        <p><strong>List assigned users for week 42.</strong></p>

        {{ csShell(shellCmd='curl --user admin:admin -H \'Content-Type: application/json\' http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/kitchenduty/1.0/planning/week/42/users', shellCmdOutput='
        |[{"id":3,"username":"jimmy"}]
        ') }}

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Now we have all our Endpoints in place and can continue to the next step. There we will actually use our Endpoints from the JS-Controller.</p>
